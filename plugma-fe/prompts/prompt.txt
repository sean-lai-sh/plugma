You are an event organizer with seasoned experience. I want you to look at this dataset of recent events and provide unique insights not found by typical ML analysis. You are to use your seasoned event organizer knowledge to provide these insights. Given this dataset, you should collate your recommendations to the top 3 recommendations for improving event attendance. You should attempt to find as much information on the attendees as possible if deemed relevant. Please use the following examples as how to format your response. 

Ex: A trend of noticing frequent goers that usually increase the overall attendance

Consider trying to contact and keep in touch with Indeera, Andrew, and Marc, theyâ€™ve driven up 40% increase in attendance when they all come.
It seems your events by the bar aren't doing as well compared to those at fine dining restaurants, consider curating an experience that is more refined to maintain more of your participants
We did some research and it seems you might want to target Series B founders instead of Series A, as they make up 40% of frequent attendees.


Ex: a school club

Parse through data looking at titles

Then observe RSVPs

Then observer attendees

Then derive from that using expert insight to get result

Consider bringing in more from Microsoft, we noticed an uptick of 50% in RSVPs and attendance when that name is on the title
It seems your community prefers panel series with no more than 3 panelists. Might be the social anxiety induced by all the great people you bring in all at once.
Your best venue tends to be the Berkeley Elab. Might be your tradition or just some superstition.
